- **NL Seminar-From Constrained Event Sequences Generation TO Text Generation** <br>
USC ISI. Aug 2022. <br>

Abstract: Understanding events is a critical component of natural language understanding NLU. 
A key challenge lies in the fact that events can be described in different granularities. 
A coarse grained event e.g., publishing a paper can often be disseminated into a fine grained process 
of events e.g., writing the paper, passing the peer review, and presenting at the conference. In this work, 
we tackle the problem of goal oriented event process generation, where a task goal event, a process that completes 
this goal is automatically generated. We tackle this task with a constrained generation approach, inferring unobserved event chains based on existing sequences. To leverage prior knowledge to facilitate commonsense reasoning, we employ pre trained LMs to generate event sequences and to retrieve original stories.
