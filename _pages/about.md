Hello! I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at UCLA conducting Natural Language Processing research, working with Professor [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/). Previously, I had the fortune to work with Professor [Jonathan May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) and Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) at USC, ISI as a summer intern.
