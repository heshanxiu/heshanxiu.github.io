Hello! I am Shanxiu He, a Computer Science Phd Candidate at UCSB with Professor Tao Yang. My research focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency tradeoffs for neural information retrieval problems and builds retrieval models with strong zero-shot abilities.

During my undergraduate study at UCLA, I was advised by Professor [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/). In summer 2021, I had the fortune to work with Professor [Jonathan May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) and Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) at USC, ISI.
