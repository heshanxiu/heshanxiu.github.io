Hello! I am a Computer Science Phd Candidate at UCSB with Professor Tao Yang. My research focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency tradeoffs for neural information retrieval problems.

During my undergraduate study at UCLA, I had to fortune to work with Professor [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) on structural learning of vision-and-language models.
In summer 2021, I had the fortune to work with Professor [Jonathan May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) and 
Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) at USC, ISI.
