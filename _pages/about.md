Hello! I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at UCLA. My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
More specifically, I am interested in knowledge-enhanced natural language generation (NLG), machine commonsense, and event information.

During my undergraduate study, I work with Professor [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) on structural learning of vision-and-language models.
In summer 2021, I had the fortune to work with Professor [Jonathan May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) and 
Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) at USC, ISI as an NLP intern.

In my free time, I like reading, painting, and baking.
